# Cryptocurrencies

This purpose of this project is to use unsupervised learning to group cryptocurrencies through a clustering algorithm. 

I first prepared and preprocessed the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means. I then reduced the data dimensions with PCA algorithms and predicted the clusters using K-means, both from sklearn. Lastly, I created 2D and 3D scater plots and a data table to display my results.
